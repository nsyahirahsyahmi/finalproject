a) Introduction

As we all know, the world is currently going through a global pandemic known as COVID-19. COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Hence, it is important to practice social distancing to lower the risk of getting infected. To avoid Mahallah Asiah's Cafeteria from being too crowded with people, which would make social distancing impossible, we have decided to develop a web application where customers can view the menu and order online. This will help create a systematic work flow. By browsing the menu online, customers no longer need to physically go to the cafeteria just to look at the menu of the day. If they are interested with the menu, they can straight away order it online and only go to the cafeteria once their order is ready. This can not only decrease the number of people in the cafeteria, but also save customer's time.

b) Objective

To create a user-friendly web application where user can easily order food and beverage of their choice.
To create a web application where user can browse the menu of the day for Mahallah Asiah's cafeteria.
To create an environment where social distancing is practiced on a daily basis.
To ease caterer and chef's job of handling multiple orders.
